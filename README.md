# Overture Maps: Categorizing POIs along Overture’s Places Category Schema

## Project Overview
This repository contains work for my master’s capstone project, which explores the use of large language models to assist with categorizing Places of Interest (POIs) in the Overture Maps dataset according to Overture’s Places Category Schema.

The goal of this project is to analyze how automated categorization methods compare to existing labels in terms of consistency, coverage, and common error patterns.
